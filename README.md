# SpamDetector

SpamDetector is a deep learning-based multilingual spam classification system. It leverages both Persian and English email datasets, FastText embeddings, and a hybrid LSTM-CNN architecture built using TensorFlow/Keras.

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model is designed to classify emails as `spam` or `ham` based on their content. It combines:

- **Pretrained FastText Embeddings** for multilingual text understanding
- **1D Convolution + MaxPooling** for feature extraction
- **Bidirectional LSTM** for sequential modeling
- **Dropout layers** for regularization
- **Sigmoid output** for binary classification

## 🗂️ Dataset

Two datasets are used:

- `email_spam.csv`: Preprocessed dataset with `"text"` and `"type"` columns (`ham`/`spam`)
- `emails.csv`: Mixed-language dataset with `"text"` and binary `spam` labels (`0` = ham, `1` = spam)

All datasets are encoded dynamically using `charset_normalizer` to handle mixed-language characters.

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Pipeline

1. Remove punctuation from email content
2. Normalize labels (`0`/`1` → `ham`/`spam`)
3. Tokenize and convert to sequences
4. Pad all sequences to a max length of `400`
5. Split into train and test sets (80/20)

---

## 🔨 Training Setup

- Embedding layer initialized with FastText
- Optimizer: `adam`
- Loss function: `binary_crossentropy`
- Epochs: 10 (with checkpoints)
- Max sequence length: 400
- Batch size: 64

Model performance is logged and best model is saved to `/Model`.

---

## 📊 Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**
- **F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report (precision, recall)**

All metrics are visualized using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

---

## 🚀 Inference

To make predictions on new messages:

```python
# Preprocess new emails
prepared_df, X, tokenizer, vocab_size = prepare_spam_data(sample_emails, sample_labels, tokenizer)

# Predict
y_pred_prob = model.predict(X)
y_pred = (y_pred_prob > 0.5).astype("int32")
````

Example messages (Persian + English) are also included in the notebook for real-world testing.
